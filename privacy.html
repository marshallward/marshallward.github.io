Google apps now require privacy policies, even for ridiculous little apps like
Tipper.

As I am not a lawyer, I do not know what a proper privacy policy looks like.

I can only offer assurance that this goofy little app has no interest in your
personal details, and will not use them for any purpose whatsoever.

Enjoy.
